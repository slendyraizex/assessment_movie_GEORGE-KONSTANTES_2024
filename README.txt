This is my coursework on Mobile Computing the Mobile Movie Explorer App.

I want to go through the process of creating my project and also make clear what exactly I have made.
So I have mostly completed what was required from the coursework and for aesthetic reasons and because
I plan to keep working on this project in my own personal time I have also added a few extra features.
When opening the app you are greeted with the startActivity which will prompt you into the loginActivity.

There loginActivity is there purely for looks and is not properly implemented as it was not required for
the coursework. You log in with username and password credentials: username: test password: test
Register now would have redirected you to a registerActivity where you would create an account but I
didn't bother for now as I had tight time constraints and more important things to implement.

After you login you are greeted with the mainActivity. The search bar at the top is not functional, you
can input text but it will do nothing. Next we have the three recycler views with the movies sorted by
Best(highest vote average), Most Popular(highest popularity score) and Recent Releases (release date).
At the bottom i created a bottomAppBar that can redirect from the mainActivity (Explore) into the
favoritesActivity (Favorites) the third button
